## 贡献

There’s several ways to contribute, not just by writing code.
If you have questions, see [§ Support][support].
If you can provide financial support, see [§ Sponsor][sponsor].

### 改进文档

As a user you’re perfect for helping us improve our docs.
Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, new examples, etcetera.
All MDX docs live in `docs/`.

You can run the docs locally, see [¶ Site][site] below.

### 改进问题

Some issues lack information, aren’t reproducible, or are just incorrect.
You can help by trying to make them easier to resolve.
Existing issues might benefit from your unique experience or opinions.

### 编写代码

Code contributions are very welcome.
It’s probably a good idea to first post a question or open an issue to report a
bug or suggest a new feature before creating a pull request.

## 提交问题

- The issue tracker is for issues.
  Use discussions for support
- Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new
  issue
- Ensure you’re using the latest version of our packages
- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue,
  error message, version, operating system, etcetera
- The more time you put into an issue, the better we will be able to help you
- The best issue report is a [failing test][unit-test] proving it

## 提交拉取请求

- See [¶ Project][project] below for info on how the project is structured,
  how to test, and how to build the site
- Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent
  you from doing unnecessary work
- For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the
  community for feedback as soon as possible
- New features should be accompanied by tests and documentation
- Don’t include unrelated changes
- Test before submitting code by running `npm test`
- Write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request:
  it’s your job to convince us

## Project

### Structure

MDX is a monorepo.
All packages are in `packages/`.
Documentation is in `docs/`.

### 测验

To run the tests, first do `npm install`, then do `npm test`.
This ensures everything is okay, from code style to unit tests to types.

### 站点

To build the site, first do `npm install`, then do `npm run docs`.
This produces the website in `public/`.

### 释放

To release a new version, do:

1. update `version`s of packages with a patch, minor, or major (make sure to
   update dependency ranges on monorepo packages when needed):
   ```sh
   npm version minor --workspaces --no-git-tag-version
   ```
2. commit and tag using the version (without `v`) as the message:
   ```sh
   git commit --all --message 1.2.3 && git tag 1.2.3 && git push && git push --tags
   ```
3. release to the npm registry:
   ```sh
   npm publish --workspaces
   ```
4. add a changelog entry for the release on GitHub:
   ```sh
   open https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/releases
   ```
